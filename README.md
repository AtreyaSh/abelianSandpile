# Abelian Sandpile Cascade Effect

## Background

The Abelian sandpile is an interesting example of a well-ordered game which leads to very interesting results, especially in the context of self-organized criticiality. Here we will experiment with the Abelian sandpile using python scripts.

The inspiration for this project was drawn from a recent [Numberphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MtEUErz7Gg) video. Kudos to them for making mathematics so accessible to the general public.

## Algorithm

Note: Algorithm and explanations are still under develeopment. Changes will be coming to the structure and efficiency of our code

Here are nice gifs that we made to visualize the 2-dimensional Abelian sandpile cascade effect.

The following animation shows the cascading effect from a fixed perspective, such that one can observe how the sandpile expands. This emphasizes holistic structural changes.

This next animation shows the cascading effect from a varying perspective, such that the sandpile is constantly in focus. This emphasizes internal structural changes.

Math is beautiful!

## Developments

In the coming time, we hope to convert the above 2-dimensional visualization into a 3-dimensional animation. This way, we will have a clearer idea of feedback cascade effects as the sandpile progresses.

We would also like to extend an intrinsic 2-dimensional sandpile into a 3-dimensional sandpile. We will try to make 3-dimensional shadows of 4-dimensional slices, still figuring it what this means...
